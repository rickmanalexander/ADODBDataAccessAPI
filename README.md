# ADODBDataAccessAPI
A heavily object oriented solution that wraps the core functionality of the MS ActiveX Data Objects Library. This is a highly modified version of Mathieu Guindon (@retailcoder)'s code from here: https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/examples/tree/master/SecureADODB. This Library addresses many of the commonly missed caveats like acurately monitoring an object's state using bitwise checks, spining up async commands, and and providing the ability to await their results or process other items during execution.
