# ADODBDataAccessAPI
A heavily object oriented solution that wraps the core functionality of the MS ActiveX Data Objects Library. This is a highly modified version of Mathieu Guindon (@retailcoder)'s code from here: https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/examples/tree/master/SecureADODB. This Library addresses many of the commonly missed caveats like accurately monitoring an object's state using bit-wise checks, spinning up async commands, and and providing the ability to await their results or process other items during execution.
